# Story
## Beginning 

Game starts with black scene everywhere...
Your mind keeps repeating "KNIGHT TO QUEENS Bishop Three" to you again and again. And you wake up in a shock. 
You are in a *hospital* with your sister Chloe, sitting next to you. You are confused why are you in a hospital and all of a sudden your sister shouts seeing you. She says, "DOCTOR ! DOCTOR !! He's finally AWAKE".
Hearing these words, doctor comes for you and get you checked up. 
After the checkup, your sister tells you about what happened with you.
Fade out to close the scene 

## Introduction

You were 11 years old when your father sent you to Brecker's School for the gifted. It was a boarding school and you stayed there for 7 years. You had just graduated from the school and your father was there for your graduation. You both were coming back home in car (*dramatic music starts playing using triggers/ks*), when your car crashed. Our father died in the crash (*music slows down in volume*). And.. and you went in coma (*Music rises again*).  It's been 11 months since. (*Music ends*)

You ask your sister few questions like, "How did the accident happened ?" , "Who all knew about this accident ?" and most importantly, "Was it an **accident ?** "
After that you go to rest.

**4 Weeks Later**

It's been 4 weeks since you woke up. There have been many physical and mental therapies for you since and now you are fit to go back home.

## 2 Lifes

After getting accommodated to your new house, your step-sister, Alexandria and your step-mother, Jessica, you go to your father's lawyers to read out the will. Norton, your father's lawyer tells you about 2 wills and estates. Your father, Michael Roberts, a real estate broker and family man had 2 lifes. His real name was Johnathan Von Horne. He legally changed his name before meeting your real mother and step mother. The Von Horne will states you as the sole owner of all his properties and funds. Roberts will states you as the owner of the funds for your studies (me, Chloe and Alexandria). You have 40% ownership in house, chloe has 40% and Alexandria + Jessica = 20%. You are 50% co owners in Jessica's coffee shop and her sister Elizabeth's bakery. You also receive a box which has a letter from your father from you. You leave the building to go home and rest in park.

## The Letter

Dear son, if you have this box, then I am missing or presumed dead. Or worse, actually dead. Anyways, this means something has gone wrong and you are in charge of my business. At the time of writing this, you are about to graduate and I am very proud of you. This document has list of all important contacts you would need. You have attended the most exclusive school in the world. Only the world's most powerful people send their kids for studying there. I was able to go and send you because of our grandfather. You have to make one important choice. Either continue with our business or destroy everything in this box and live your own life. Think properly about this and don't make a rush decision. Also, if you choose family business it can be dangerous as well. By the way, you had a great talent in photography, you can open a photo studio in the town meanwhile as well. Also, don't trust people easily. There are only few people I trust completely. The five people who worked for me at the **Frontier Global** and my **quadmates** from the school. You can trust these people with your life as well. Don't indulge the family in this as it could get dangerous. Whatever you do, I am proud of you. Good luck for life son, I love you.

## New Starting

*With these a series of challenges begin for you, where you need to protect your family, know about bitter truths, come across with your old friends and real mother. Things can get dangerous but you are determined to find about the death of your father and will do whatever it takes to find it. But will you be able to do with people you have never met. Can you trust them ? Will you be able to survive on your own money ? Will your homecoming be beneficial ? One mistake and you will be dead.*
